## Background
League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game where two teams (blue and red) compete to destroy each other's Nexus. The game takes place on Summoner's Rift, featuring three lanes (top, mid, and bot) guarded by turrets and a jungle filled with neutral monsters and objectives like Dragon and Baron Nashor. Players choose from five roles: top, jungle, mid, bot ADC (Attack Damage Carry), and support, each with unique responsibilities. Success requires teamwork, strategic map control, and coordination to outmaneuver opponents and secure victory.
