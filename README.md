## Background
This project aims to predict the winner of the League of Legends game based on the data collected during the first 10 mimutes of approximately 10,000 ranked games. We also dived deep into exploring the causal relationship between players' actions and the result of the game.

## League of Legends Introduction
League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game where two teams (blue and red) compete to destroy each other's Nexus. The game takes place on Summoner's Rift, featuring three lanes (top, mid, and bot) guarded by turrets and a jungle filled with neutral monsters and objectives like Dragon and Baron Nashor. Players choose from five roles: top, jungle, mid, bot ADC (Attack Damage Carry), and support, each with unique responsibilities. Success requires teamwork, strategic map control, and coordination to outmaneuver opponents and secure victory.
